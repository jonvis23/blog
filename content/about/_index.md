# **My Resume**

## Summary
Analytical professional with a strong foundation in data science and analytics, now applying that precision to cybersecurity, cloud, and network infrastructure. I actively work with SIEM tools, vulnerability assessment methodologies, and threat intelligence frameworks to identify risks before they become incidents and to help organizations build stronger, more resilient systems.

## Work Experience


### Safaricom PLC
_Nairobi, Kenya_ <br>
**`Business Intelligence Analyst`** <br>
_September 2023 to April 2024_

Although my role at Safaricom was titled Business Intelligence Analyst, my work operated with a DevSecOps and systems mindset, owning critical reporting pipelines that interfaced directly with operational databases, automated ingestion workflows, and validation layers requiring strict access control, consistency checks, and failure handling. Beyond building dashboards with Qlik Sense, SQL, and Excel, I focused on hardening data pipelines against drift and corruption, automating anomaly detection, and reducing manual intervention points that introduced operational and security risk—efforts that cut monthly reporting effort by ~80% while improving accuracy and auditability. Working cross-functionally across product and operations exposed me to real-world system failures such as misconfigurations, broken dependencies, and delayed alerts, which became the inflection point where I intentionally aligned my analytics background with cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and reliability engineering, using data not just to explain outcomes but to reduce risk before incidents occur.

### Absa Bank Kenya
_Nairobi, Kenya_ <br>
**`Tech ServiceDesk Intern`** <br>
